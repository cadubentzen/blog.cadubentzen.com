        <p>I'm Carlos Bentzen and this is my personal blog. Here, I'll post mostly about programming related topics.</p>
<p>What about this website's name? <span lang="pt-BR">Soneca</span> means nap in pt-BR, and <span lang="pt-BR">Pudim</span>
means Flan. My cat is named <span lang="pt-BR">Pudim</span> and he naps all the time, hence this blog's name.
One goal here is to include a picture of him at the end of every post. üê±</p>
<p>Here's this blog's favicon in high resolution:</p>

<hr />
<p>A small digression about Pudim: in Brazil, it's typically made with condensed milk, and there's a variant that's
specially delicious which also adds corn to the mix. I'd definitely recommend and if you want try and make it,
it's called <span lang="pt-BR"><q>Pudim de milho verde</q></span> and you can find recipes online.</p>
